Performance optimization considerations

Use dedicated virtual warehouses
Segregate the virtual warehouses for different workloads
(one virtual house) = (one business scenario, ex: ETL/Data Science/BI/Ad-hoc) = (one kind of workload/queries) = (a group of users, set default virtual house) = (one role)
Do not go too fine grained

Scale up for known large workloads
Sacle the size of the virtual warehouse according to known patterns

Scale out for unknown & unexpected workloads
Auto spawn virtual warehouse based on workloads

Design to maximize cache usage
Caching is automatic, but usage can be maximized

Use cluster keys to partition large tables
For tables that have very large data use cluster keys to improve query performance
